# Obstacle-Detecting-Four-Wheel-Drive-4WD
•	A four-wheel drive vehicle was made using Arduino Uno R3 and a motor shield over it. An ultrasonic sensor was used to detect obstacles and a program was made to move away when and obstacle is detected.
•	The model consisted of an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor for a complete surveillance for the obstacle.
•	Four TT motors were used to drive the wheels along with the chassis. The microcontroller and its motor shield is connected to a portable battery source to make this project completely portable and self-sufficient.
